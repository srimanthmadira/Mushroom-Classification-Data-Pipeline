# Mushroom-Classification-Data-Pipeline
This project implements a data pipeline for classifying mushrooms as poisonous or edible based on their attributes.

<h2>Description</h2>"Mushroom-Classification-Data-Pipeline" project, I developed a comprehensive data pipeline to classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible based on their attributes. Utilizing CSV data, I built a MySQL database with Train, Test, and Synthetic tables. Through advanced data exploration, I conducted feature analysis and transformation to optimize data quality. I implemented a probabilistic classifier to predict mushroom edibility and evaluated model performance using a confusion matrix. The project highlights my ability to manage data pipelines, perform in-depth analysis, and develop machine learning models to derive actionable insights for classification tasks.

- Phase 1: Data exploration, shaping, and sampling, with data stored in CSV files.
- Phase 2: Development of MySQL tables (Train, Test, Synthetic) to store and manage the data.
- Phase 3: Implementation of a probabilistic classifier to predict mushroom edibility, evaluated using a confusion matrix.
